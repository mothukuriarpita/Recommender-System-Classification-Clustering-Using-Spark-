# Recommender-System-Classification-Clustering-Using-Spark-
<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
This project consists of 5 parts. Given below are details:
<ul>
  <li>Implementing collaborative filtering, low-rank matrix factorization, generating different models and finding out best model by computing root mean square error.</li>
  <li>Generating ALS model on movielens dataset and computing RMSE</li>
  <li>Implementing Spark MLib using pipelines for pre-processing, paramgridbuilder, crossvalidator, generating  logistic regression model and outputting the classification metrics.</li>
  <li>Repetaing the above step with dimensionality reduction</li></ul>
 
 <h3><u>Implementation</u></h3>
 This project has been impleented using PySpark, Scala and Spark Mlib.
